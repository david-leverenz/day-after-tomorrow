# Day After Tomorrow
On Day After Tomorrow a person can enter any city and a date in the near future to get the forecast for that day, a map of the city and a list of some cool things to do while there.  It saves all searches and allows you to re-initiate those searches with the click of a button.<br>
## Description
Our website uses the Tailwind CSS framework (a framework other than Bootstrap).<br>
It was deployed to GitHub Pages.<br>
It is interactive (i.e. can accept and respond to user input).<br>
It uses two different server-side APIs (four api calls).<br>
It still has some alerts.  We weren't able to change them to modals due to time contraints.<br>
It uses client-side storage to store persistent data.<br>
It is responsive.<br>
It has a semi-polished UI that time constraints prevented from being a polished UI.<br>
It has a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).<br>
It has a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot (to be added after CSS changes), and link to deployed application).<br>
